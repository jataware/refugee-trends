# Refugee Trends

This project builds on the work done by University of Oulu, University of Melbourne, and Harokopio University of Athens in their paper [Correlating Refugee Border Crossings with Internet Search Data](http://jultika.oulu.fi/files/nbnfi-fe201901222715.pdf). In that paper, they attempted to answer the question _Can Internet search data be used as a proxy to predict refugee  mobility?_. Per their findings, "Results indicate that the reuse of internet search data considerably improves the predictive power of the models." However, this research solely focused on refugees fleeing North Africa and the Middle East for Greece. This project aims to apply these techniques to refugees fleeing Somalia and South Sudan for Ethiopia.
